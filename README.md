This is a collection of IPython notebooks and learning resources for an Introduction to Programming class, focusing on Python.

Goals:
- introduce students as quickly as possible to the basics of programming, and then help them choose an interesting project that they are capable of completing.
- introduce best practice as early as possible, while remaining accessible to students with zero background in programming.
