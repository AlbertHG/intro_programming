      "A terminal application is simply an application that runs inside the terminal. By now, you have seen that most of the output from your programs is printed to the terminal. By learning a few more techniques such as clearing the terminal screen and \"pickling\" data, you can create full-fledged standalone applications that run in the terminal.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Open a terminal and enter `top`.\n",
