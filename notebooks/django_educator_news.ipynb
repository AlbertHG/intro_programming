This is rarely a recipe for success; it is almost always good to put some of your ideas and goals into writing first. Before writing any code it is good to lay out a clear vision, and then lay out a series of goals that you aim to achieve. This will help guide you into developing the product you want, rather than being pulled into something that is easy or satisfying to code but may be less useful."

The point of Django's distinction between projects and apps is to allow you to develop reusable *apps* that can be used within different *projects*. So if you have a blog *app*, you can use it in any number of your projects. The people who maintain Django want you to be able to share your apps with other developers, and use common apps within your larger project.\n",

However, you can't have an app with the same name as your project, otherwise there would be naming conflicts in the actual code.\n",
