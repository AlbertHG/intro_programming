I have seen at least one attempt at making a clone of HN for education, but the project did not go anywhere. This is an attempt to make an HN-inspired site for education. In the process, you will see how to build, deploy, and maintain a web application using the Django framework."

      "When creating a new project that you are excited about, it is tempting to jump right into writing code. This is rarely a recipe for success; it is almost always good to put some of your ideas and goals into writing first. Before writing any code it is good to lay out a clear vision, and then lay out a series of goals that you aim to achieve. This will help guide you into developing the product you want, rather than being pulled into something that is easy or satisfying to code but may be less useful."
