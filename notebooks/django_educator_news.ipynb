      "I have learned a lot from reading Hacker News over the last few years, and I have wished there was a similar forum for gathering and discussing articles related to education. I have seen at least one attempt at making a clone of HN for education, but the project did not go anywhere. This is an attempt to make an HN-inspired site for education. In the process, you will see how to build, deploy, and maintain a web application using the Django framework."
