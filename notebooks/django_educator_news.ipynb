This is rarely a recipe for success; it is almost always good to put some of your ideas and goals into writing first. Before writing any code it is good to lay out a clear vision, and then lay out a series of goals that you aim to achieve. This will help guide you into developing the product you want, rather than being pulled into something that is easy or satisfying to code but may be less useful."
